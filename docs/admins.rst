Setting up koji for container image builds

.. _config.yaml:

Server-side Configuration for atomic-reactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will list the maximum number of jobs that should be active at any
given time for each cluster. It will also list worker clusters in
order of preference.

The runtime configuration will take the form of a Kubernetes secret
with content as in the example below::

  clusters:
    x86_64:
    - name: prod-x86_64-osd
      max_concurrent_builds: 16
    - name: prod-x86_64
      max_concurrent_builds: 6
      enabled: true
    - name: prod-other
      max_concurrent_builds: 2
      enabled: false

    ppc64le:
    - name: prod-ppc64le
      max_concurrent_builds: 6

.. _config.yaml-clusters:

clusters
''''''''

This maps each platform to a list of clusters and their concurrent
build limits. For each platform to build for, a worker cluster is
chosen as follows:

- clusters with the enabled key set to false are discarded
  
- each remaining cluster in turn will be queried to discover all
  currently active worker builds (not failed, complete, in error, or
  cancelled)

- the cluster load is computed by dividing the number of active worker
  builds by the specified maximum number of concurrent builds allowed
  on the cluster

- the worker build is submitted to whichever cluster has the lowest
  load; in this way, an even load distribution across all clusters is
  enforced

There are several throttles preventing too many worker builds being
submitted. Each worker cluster can be configured to only schedule a
certain number of worker builds at a time by setting a default
resource request. The orchestrator cluster will similarly only run a
certain number of orchestrator builds at a time based on the resource
request in the orchestrator build JSON template. A Koji builder will
only run a certain number of containerbuild tasks based on its
configured capacity.

This mechanism can also be used to temporarily disable a worker
cluster by removing it from the list or adding ``enabled: false`` to
the cluster description for each platform.
